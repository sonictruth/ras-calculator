            <p>Your result indicates that you are still in the reproductive period or in the very
            beginning of your menopausal transition. Blood concentrations of follicle stimulating
            hormone (FSH) are still low and concentrations of estrogens high.
            </p>
            <p>This is a good time to inform yourself about the health effects that may come with
            menopause and therapeutic options to counteract them. Adapting your diet to increase
            estrogen rich foods such as flax seeds, soybeans and dried fruit can be beneficial.

            when you will complete the menopausal transition.

            <p>After your menstrual periods become irregular, birth control is still warranted, even if
            you feel beginning symptoms of the menopausal transition, such as hot flushes or
            night sweats.

            <p>Your result indicates that you have entered your menopausal transition.Blood
            concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone(FSH) are rising and concentrations of
            estrogens will steadily decline.
            </p>
            <p>This is a good time to talk to your gynaecologist or health professional to elaborate an
            individualized plan guiding you through the transition and determining if you are at
            risk for specific health issues such as <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/48/suppl_60/OA4998">accelerated lung function decline</a>  or <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674915012439">asthma</a>.

            <p>Your result indicates that you are well into your menopausal transition.Blood
            concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone(FSH) are still rising and
            concentrations of estrogens keep declining.
            </p>
            <p>Transitional symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats lower the quality of life
            substantially but can be treated efficiently with hormone therapy, which should be
            started during the transitional phase even if the interest is maintaining long term
            health.

            <p>Your result indicates that you have completed your menopausal transition or will do
            so soon.Blood concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone(FSH) and estrogens
            are reaching a steady postmenopausal state.
            </p>
            <p>This is a good time to concern yourself with maintaining health and quality of life.
            Managing external factors such as <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378512220304655">
                sunlight exposure</a> may be helpful.
            </p>
            <p>Completing the menopausal transition eventually eliminates the need for birth control
            and the absence of menstruations means also no more premenstrual syndrome(PMS).
